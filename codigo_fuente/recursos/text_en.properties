inicio.texto = "Five Generations of Mezcal Tradition Support Us..."

# P\u00e1gina de historia ###############################################################################

historia.titulo = Our History

historia.parrafo1 = The presence of our Mezcal in the northern region of the state of Guerrero \
  \u2014and the surrounding areas of Morelos and Mexico\u2014 dates from, at least, six generations of the \
  <i>Figueroa Family</i>.

historia.parrafo2 = Combined for many years with other activities, among them the sowing of cane \
  and the production of rum, the manufacture of mezcal is result of perpetuating local traditions, \
  heirs of our prehispanic roots, of Mexico and the universe of maguey and pulque, and at the same \
  time of Spain, the distillation and the Arabs.

historia.parrafo3 = The brothers Ricardo and Francisco, later Don Amado and Don Margarito, and in \
  more recent times, Don Ricardo, \u2014always by the hand of Florentina, Do\u00f1a Isidora, Aunt Ema, Aunt \
  Gabina and Do\u00f1a Ilse\u2014 are some of our ancestors, whose effort has transformed the mezcal, from \
  being a complementary activity, through the periods of persecution and the fearsome tax \
  inspections that visit us since the 1940s, by a careful and measured modernization, until making \
  it our passion, and a dream in constant process of materialization.

historia.parrafo4 = Today, <b>Mezcal Amaxak</b> is the heir of this legacy, in whose history are \
  interlaced names \u2014such as <i>Mezcal Figueroa</i> and <i>Mezcal El Platanar</i>\u2014, and places \
  \u2014such as El Milagro, Pilcaya, El Despoblado or El Platanar\u2014, perpetuating the family tradition, \
  and being elaborated since, at least, 1875 in the Factory of Mezcal <i>El Refugio</i>.

procesos.titulo = Our Processes

procesos.parrafo1 = The mezcal is a beverage that is deeply rooted in the life and culture of the \
  state of Guerrero, and in the case of <b>Amaxak</b>, it is the result of revaluing the \
  characteristics that make it unique in the diverse world of mezcals.

procesos.parrafo2 = The production of our mezcal begins with the sowing of the raw material, a \
  regional variety of espad\u00edn maguey, also known as angosto or criollo. This is planted in abrupt \
  and fragmented land with little cultivation areas, taking from 5 to 7 years to be mature. After \
  that time, it is harvested and moved to the factory, to make way for the mezcal manufacturing \
  process.

procesos.parrafo3 = Once in our facilities, the agave cores are weighed and fit around a conical \
  furnace dug in the ground and covered with volcanic stone. With several hours of anticipation, \
  the oven is ignited, same that will be fed with harvested wood. As soon as it has reached the \
  ideal temperature, the \u201cpi\u00f1as\u201d are overturned to the interior, forming a cone that is covered \
  with banana leaves and soil, to make the cooking process which will last several days.

procesos.parrafo4 = Done the cooking, the maguey is cutted into smaller pieces to be crushed and \
  torn. The resulting bagasse is fermented in tubs with water, transformed by the action of its \
  own yeasts into alcohols.

procesos.parrafo5 =  After the fermentation, the double distillation is carried out, a process to \
  separate the different alcohols and obtain the Young Mezcal, made in a copper still with direct \
  fire. Later we can take this mezcal to rest in oak barrels, or use it in the preparation of our \
  famous liquor.

procesos.parrafo6 = All processes of maguey cultivation, manufacturing and bottling of our \
  products are strictly monitored by the <b>Mezcal Regulatory Board</b>, providing certification \
  of <b>NOM 070</b>, which regulates the <b>Denomination of Origin</b> of mezcal.

procesos.parrafo7 = Along with perpetuating artisanal techniques and carefully incorporating the \
  modern ones, in the mezcal factory "<i>El Refugio</i>", we are aware of our environmental and \
  social responsibility. For more than twenty years, we have encouraged the creation of agave \
  nurseries and plantations, reforestation and the sustainable management of natural and water \
  resources, as well as production waste. On the other hand, we see the generation of employment \
  sources as an intrinsic value of mezcal, which is the support of numerous families that \
  participate in its elaboration.
