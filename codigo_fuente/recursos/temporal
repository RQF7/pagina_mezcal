Our History
The presence of our Mezcal in the North Region of the state of Guerrero - and the surrounding areas of Morelos and Mexico - dates from, at least, six generations of the Figueroa Family. Combined for many years with other activities, among them the sowing of cane and the production of rum, the manufacture of mezcal is result of perpetuating local traditions, heirs of our prehispanic roots, of Mexico and the universe of maguey and pulque, and at the same time of Spain, the distillation and the Arabs.
The brothers Ricardo and Francisco, later Don Amado and Don Margarito, and in more recent times, Don Ricardo, - always by the hand of Florentina, Doña Isidora, Aunt Ema, Aunt Gabina and Doña Ilse, are some of our ancestors, whose effort has transformed the mezcal, from being a complementary activity, through the periods of persecution and the fearsome tax inspections that visit us since the 1940s, by a careful and measured modernization, until making it our passion, and a dream in constant process of materialization.
Today, Mezcal Amaxak is the heir of this legacy, in whose history are interlaced names - such as Mezcal Figueroa and Mezcal El Platanar -, and places - such as El Milagro, Pilcaya, El Despoblado or El Platanar, perpetuating the family tradition, and being elaborated since, at least, 1875 in the Factory of Mezcal El Refugio.

Our Processes
Mezcal is a beverage that is deeply rooted in the life and culture of the state of Guerrero, and in the case of Amaxak, it is the result of revaluing the characteristics that make it unique in the diverse world of mezcals.
The production of our mezcal begins with the sowing of the raw material, a regional variety of espadín maguey, also known as angosto or criollo. This is planted in abrupt and fragmented land with little cultivation areas, taking from 5 to 7 years to be mature. After that time, it is harvested and moved to the factory, to make way for the mezcal manufacturing process.
Once in our facilities, the agave cores are weighed and fit around a conical furnace dug in the ground and covered with volcanic stone. With several hours of anticipation, the oven is ignited, same that will be fed with harvested wood. As soon as it has reached the ideal temperature, the “piñas” are overturned to the interior, forming a cone that is covered with banana leaves and soil, to make the cooking process which will last several days.
Done the cooking, the maguey is cutted into smaller pieces to be crushed and torn. The resulting bagasse is fermented in tubs with water, transformed by the action of its own yeasts into alcohols.
After the fermentation, the double distillation is carried out, a process to separate the different alcohols and obtain the Young Mezcal, made in a copper still with direct fire. Later we can take this mezcal to rest in oak barrels, or use it in the preparation of our famous liquor.
All processes of maguey cultivation, manufacturing and bottling of our products are strictly monitored by the Mezcal Regulatory Board, providing certification of NOM 070, which regulates the Denomination of Origin of mezcal.
Along with perpetuating artisanal techniques and carefully incorporating the modern ones, in the mezcal factory "El Refugio", we are aware of our environmental and social responsibility. For more than twenty years, we have encouraged the creation of agave nurseries and plantations, reforestation and the sustainable management of natural and water resources, as well as production waste. On the other hand, we see the generation of employment sources as an intrinsic value of mezcal, which is the support of numerous families that participate in its elaboration.
